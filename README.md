## Why I Made This

Right now I'm in the process of looking for a fulltime gig, so I've been sifting through job descriptions and salaries. I wanted to calculate the monthly, bi weekly, and weekly quickly, so I figured I'll make AND use Angular.js.

## Why Angular?

Lots of job's are asking for atleast working knowledge of it, so and I've wanted to learn for a few months now but never had the time. The need of on the fly updating values made Angular become an obvious decision.

## Technologies used
* Angular.js - The two way data binding model attracted me the most. Being able to see the results on the fly was also a pro.
* Bootstrap - mainly used for the styles and clean look
* jQuery - Bootstrap was throwing an error in the javascript console. And it bothered me. That's literally the only reason I included it.

## To-Dos
* Add bi-weekly
* Add weekly
* Reverse converstion (ie given hourly rate calculate weekly, bi-weekly, annual based on 40 hour work weeks)
* Be able to add input $1,000,000 or $100k and still get correct results
* Estimate weekly tax witholding (Massachusetts at first)
